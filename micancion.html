        I'd like to say we gave it a try <br>
        I'd like to blame it all on life <br>
        Maybe we just weren't right, <br>
        But that's a lie, that's a lie <br>

        And we can deny it as much as we want <br>
        But in time our feelings will show <br>

    <p id="parrafo3">
        'Cause sooner or later <br>
        We'll wonder why we gave up <br>

        Almost, almost is never enough <br>
        So close to being in love <br>
        If I would have known that you wanted me <br>
        The way I wanted you <br>
        Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart <br>
        But right here in each others arms <br>

    <p id="parrafo5">
        Here we almost, we almost knew what love was <br>
        But almost is never enough <br>
    </p> If I could change the world overnight <br>
    There'd be no such thing as goodbye <br>
    You'll be standing right where you were <br>
    And we'd get the chance we deserve oh <br>
